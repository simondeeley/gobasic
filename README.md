## What is it?
At the moment, GoBasic is a toy project exploring how to develop a lexer and parser using the `golang` language.  It aims to reignite the love with good ol' BASIC programming languages (remember those?).  Inspiration for this comes from a nostalgic look back Atari ST(E)'s from the late 80's and early 90's and the [STOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOS_BASIC) programming language disks that came with them.

I will update this README with more information as the project develops!
